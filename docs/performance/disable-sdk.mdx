title: Disable Firebase Performance Monitoring
---

During app development and testing, you might find it useful to disable
Performance Monitoring.

To stop custom data collection, you can call `setPerformanceCollectionEnabled`
as in the following example:

```dart
FirebasePerformance performance = FirebasePerformance.instance;

// Custom data collection is, by default, enabled
bool isEnabled = await performance.isPerformanceCollectionEnabled();

// Set data collection to `false`
await performance.setPerformanceCollectionEnabled(false);
```
